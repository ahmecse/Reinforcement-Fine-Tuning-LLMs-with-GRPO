# Reinforcement-Fine-Tuning-LLMs-with-GRPO
RFT with GRPO: RFT helps adapt LLMs to complex reasoning tasks like math and coding by using reinforcement learning, enabling models to develop their own strategies instead of mimicking examples as in SFT. GRPO, a tailored RL algorithm, excels in tasks with verifiable outcomes and works well with small datasets.
